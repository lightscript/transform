# @lightscript/transform

Compiles [LightScript](http://wcjohnson.github.io/lightscript) to JavaScript when used with [Babel](http://babeljs.io).

### Usage

Please consult the documentation at [the @oigroup/LightScript website](http://wcjohnson.github.io/lightscript).

We recommend using the Babel preset. However, if you decide to use the plugin as a standalone Babel module, please note that the code generated is ES2018+ and will not yet run in many browsers. When using the preset, this is taken care of for you.
